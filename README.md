Haminator is a small project for Spark Core to monitor the hams curing in my cellar, recording the
state regularly and eventually flagging any critical situations.
Haminator currently measures temperature, humidy, and light levels.  Next feature will be a weight scale so we
can match the environment humidity to 10 points below the estimated ham moisture level.
